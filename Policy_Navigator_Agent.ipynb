EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. States are required to develop a general plan to attain and maintain the NAAQS in all areas of the country, and a specific plan to attain the standards for each area designated nonattainment for a NAAQS.Laws and Regulations\\\\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS): standards and implementation information for each of the six common air pollutants.

These New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) apply to newly constructed sources or those that undergo major upgrades or modifications. The standards include both equipment specifications as well as operation and measurement requirements.Laws and Regulations\\\\nNew Source Performance Standards: includes selected NSPS.\\\\xa0 NSPS are published at 40 CFR 60.\\\\nCompliance\\\\nNew Source Performance Standards and State Improvement Plans Compliance Monitoring\\\\nApplicability Determination Index (ADI): NSPS and NESHAP memoranda and letters, including applicability determinations and regulatory interpretations.\\\\nNew Source Review (NSR)/Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires all areas of the country to meet or strive to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). One of the key programs designed to achieve compliance with the NAAQS is the New Source Review (NSR) program, a preconstruction review process for new and modified stationary sources.Laws and Regulations\\\\nNSR: Regulations and Standards\\\\nCompliance\\\\nRACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC): database with case-specific information on the \"Best Available\" air pollution technologies that have been required to reduce the emission of air pollutants from stationary sources\\\\nEnforcement\\\\nAir Enforcement: New Source Review and Prevention of Significant Deterioration\\\\nPolicy and Guidance\\\\nNSR: Policy and Guidance\\\\nNew Source Review Policy and Guidance Database: a database with policy and guidance documents interpreting NSR and PSD construction permit regulations.\\\\nOzone Layer ProtectionUnder Title VI of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is responsible for programs that protect the stratospheric ozone layer.

Vehicle fuel standards for gasoline and diesel are met by refiners/ importers, and by other parties in the fuel distribution system.Regulation of vehicles includes vehicle emission limits for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulates in the case of diesel vehicles. These limits, which must be met by the vehicle manufacturers, apply to on-road vehicles, off-road vehicles, and non-road sources (e.g., marine engines, locomotives, and lawn and garden equipment). Under the 1990 CAA amendments, vehicle standards are being made more stringent, in stages, through 2005 or later.Vehicle safety information is available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\\\\nBrowse by vehicle/fuel type:\\\\nOn-road Vehicles and Engines\\\\nNonroad Vehicles and Engines\\\\nFuels and Fuel Additives\\\\nCars and light trucks\\\\nHeavy trucks, buses, engines\\\\nMotorcycles\\\\nAircraft\\\\nDiesel boats and ships\\\\nForklifts, generators and compressors (gasoline and propane)\\\\nGasoline boats and personal watercraft\\\\nLawn and garden (small gasoline equipment)\\\\nLocomotives\\\\nNonroad diesel equipment\\\\nOcean vessels and large ships\\\\nSnowmobiles, dirt bikes, and ATVs\\\\nE15 (ethanol and gasoline blend)\\\\nDiesel\\\\nGasoline\\\\nRenewable and alternative fuels\\\\nBrowse by information type:Laws and Regulations\\\\nEmissions Standards Reference Guide: Federal emissions standards for on-road and nonroad vehicles and engines, and related fuel sulfur standards.\\\\nEngine Testing Regulations, including 40 CFR 1065.\\\\nMobile Sources Air Toxics: Regulations: Fuels such as ethanol, diesel fuels and more.\\\\nTransportation and Climate: Regulations and Standards\\\\nCompliance\\\\nCompliance Monitoring: Air Mobile Sources Program: Information about inspections, evaluations and investigations for vehicles, engines and fuels.\\\\nFuels and Fuel Additives: Compliance Information\\\\nImporting Vehicles and Engines\\\\nEnforcement\\\\nAir Enforcement: Mobile Sources\\\\nPolicies and Guidance\\\\nState and Local Transportation Resources: Policy and Guidance: Directions for state and local governments on how to implement strategies for controlling transportation sector emissions.\\\\nVisibility/HazeOne of the most basic forms of air pollution - haze - degrades visibility in many American cities and scenic areas.
